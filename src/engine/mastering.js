// Master-bus mastering chain (item 178) — the last thing that touches the mix
// before it narrows to 8 bits.
//
// It sits inside the output stage: the voices sum in binary64, the Amiga chain
// runs, the pair narrows to binary32 — and THEN this runs, before the clamp and
// the dither. That position is the whole point. A limiter downstream of the
// clamp would have nothing left to do, and a chain upstream of the Amiga filter
// would be mastering a signal the device never delivers.
//
// ── What it is not ──
// It makes no judgements. Every stage is a textbook block with the parameter it
// says on the tin, in a FIXED order, and nothing here looks at the music and
// decides anything. That is a design constraint, not a shortcoming: the meters
// (loudness.js) tell you what the song is doing, and you decide.
//
//     trim → high-pass → 4-band EQ → compressor → width → limiter → gain
//
// Every stage has its own on/off; the chain as a whole has one more. With
// nothing engaged the chain is not merely transparent, it is ABSENT —
// masteringEngaged() returns false and the mixer keeps the untouched legacy
// path, so a song that has never been near this tab still renders bit-for-bit
// as it did before the tab existed.
//
// Not a port: the Kotlin engine has no mastering stage, so this file — like
// spatial.js, binaural.js and analysis.js — IS the reference implementation.
// See TAUD_ENGINE_SPEC.md §12.1 for the normative description and
// TAUD_FILE_FORMAT.md §9.12 for the `sMst` section that carries the parameters.
//
// DETERMINISM: coefficients are computed in binary64 from binary32 parameters
// (the section stores f32), and the per-sample maths is binary64 like the rest
// of the mix bus. The narrowing to binary32 still happens exactly once, after
// this, where it always did.

 *   4. A moving AVERAGE over D+1 samples, which turns every step into a ramp.

 *
 * Steps 2 and 4 are what buy the guarantee. Every value the average at time n
